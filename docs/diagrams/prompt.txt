Build me a mobile-first MVP called **JoinUS** â€“ a community-as-a-service app.

Core Idea: A platform where users can discover, join, and engage with local or interest-based communities (free groups, events, paid clubs). Think Zomato + Reddit + Meetup + Telegram, but only for communities.

MVP Features:
- User onboarding (email/phone login, location access)
- Discover communities (by city, interest, nearby groups)
- Community pages (details, posts, events, members, join button)
- Feed with updates from joined communities
- Simple chat/announcement per community
- Event listings (RSVP or paid via Razorpay/Stripe)
- Community creation (basic tools for leaders)
- Push notifications

Tech Stack Preference (close to MERN):
- Frontend: React Native + Expo + TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Atlas)
- Auth: JWT + social login
- Real-time: Socket.io
- Payments: Razorpay (India) + Stripe (global)
- Cloud storage: AWS S3 for media

Keep the app **lightweight, modern, and geo-structured**. Deliver a working MVP that can be scaled later with ads, monetization tools, and a web dashboard.
